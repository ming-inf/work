= windows batch scripting

== variable scope
global: set
local: setlocal; end with endlocal, exit, or eof

in .bat files, variables need to be escaped with an extra %

== comparison
if /I string1 compare-op string2
compare-op:
\= EQU
!= NEQ
< LSS
<= LEQ
> GTR
>= GEQ

== loop
for /F "usebackq tokens=2,3,4" %%variable in (\`file-set\`) do command [command-parameters]
read each line in every file in file-set into %%variable
usebackq to escape file-set expression
tokens selects the nth position of the output and puts it into single letter variables starting with %%variable (ie if
%%variable is %%i, then 3rd token is set to %%j)
